    <h1>Max Cache Entries Demo</h1>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="service-worker.js" target="_blank">service worker</a> in this example
      demonstrates using the maxCacheEntries option to restrict the number of items that will be
      stored in the cache. It uses a dedicated cache to hold YouTube video thumbnails. That
      dedicated cache will store up to <code>10</code> results, and once that's reached, the
      least-recently used result will be deleted. It uses the <code>cacheFirst</code> strategy, so
      any responses that are still in the cache will be used directly, without going against the
      network.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cache used for YouTube thumbnail URLs is independent from the "default" cache, which is
      used for all other requests, like YouTube API responses and this page's CSS, JavaScript, and
      HTML. The page doesn't impose any upper limit on the size of that default cache, and we can
      use a <code>networkFirst</code> strategy for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a dedicated cache with <code>maxCacheEntries</code> set to handle dynamic, unbounded
      requests is a useful pattern to follow. If we just used the default cache without
      <code>maxCacheEntries</code> for the thumbnail responses, then that cache would grow in size
      as more and more searches were performed, needlessly consuming disk space for old thumbnails
      that are likely no longer needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Live Demo</h3>
    <p>
      Try increasing the number of thumbnails returned, or changing the search term, and then
      observe the cache expirations logged in the developer console.
